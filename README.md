## PowCoder | UNSW Messaging Platform

UNSW needs a change in business model. Revenue has been going down, despite the absolutely perfect MyExperience feedback.

When doing some research, UNSW found the video game industry industry, particularly mobile games like Candy Crush earn over $500 million each year.

UNSW has tasked me (Hayden), and my army of COMP1531 students with investigating the possibility of recreating this game, for UNSW profit.

Only one thing stands in the way...

Microsoft recently bought Candy Crush, and they also own UNSW's only communication platform, Microsoft Teams!

If we want to make a Candy Crush competitor, we're going to have to remake Teams first - or those Microsoft spies will shut us down before we even begin development!

The 22T2 cohort of COMP1531 students will build the backend Javascript server for a new communication platform, UNSW Treats (or just Treats for short). I plan to task future COMP6080 students to build the front-end for Treats, something you won't have to worry about.

UNSW Treats is the questionably-named communication tool that allows you to share, communicate, and collaborate virtually without intervention from Microsoft spies.

I have already specified a common interface for the frontend and backend to operate on. This allows both courses to go off and do their own development and testing under the assumption that both parties will comply with the common interface. This is the interface you are required to use.

The specific capabilities that need to be built for this project are described in the interface at the bottom. This is clearly a lot of features, but not all of them are to be implemented at once.

Good luck, and please don't tell anyone at Microsoft about this. ðŸ˜Š
